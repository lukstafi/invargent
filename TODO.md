Place for TODOs/FIXMEs, especially if not expressed in other places. See README.md for broader-scope TODOs and source code for finer-scope TODOs and FIXMEs.

* TODO: perhaps `check_connected` could be simplified or even removed from abduction?
* FIXME: repeating `newtype` and `newcons` definitions should be errors.
* FIXME: in `split`, instead of undirected connectedness `ans4`, filter atoms whose free variables have at most a single variable more than the corresponding `ans3`, and it is existential.
* TODO: Emacs does not hyperlink error communicates -- change error format?
