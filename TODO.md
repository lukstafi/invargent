* FIXME: does solving for existentials require abduction? Fix (remove?) quantifier handling for [abd_s].
* TODO: factor out joint constraint abduction scheme, available for use across sorts (v2.0).
* TODO: numerical abduction -- optimize candidate substitution selection by working incrementally as in term abduction (FIXME: what did I mean?)
* TODO: optimize abduction, especially numerical, use iterative deepening or Best-First-Search
* FIXME: a separate fallback mechanism in the main loop for each sort?
* FIXME: related--think through what _exactly_ and when _exactly_ to discard
