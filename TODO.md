Place for TODOs/FIXMEs, especially if not expressed in other places. See README.md for broader-scope TODOs and source code for finer-scope TODOs and FIXMEs.

* FIXME: does solving for existentials require abduction? Fix (remove?) quantifier handling for [abd_s].
* TODO: factor out joint constraint abduction scheme, available for use across sorts (v2.0).
* TODO: numerical abduction -- optimize candidate substitution selection by working incrementally as in term abduction (FIXME: what did I mean?)
* TODO: optimize abduction, especially numerical, use iterative deepening or Best-First-Search
* FIXME: `check_max_b: vs=t16 pms=t26 vmax=` -- empty result of `Aux.minimal` is not possible so how has this happened? Not observed to cause problems.
