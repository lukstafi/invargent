  abstract = {We study {HMG$(X)$}, an extension of the
                 constraint-based type system {HM$(X)$} with deep
                 pattern matching, polymorphic recursion, and guarded
                 algebraic data types. Guarded algebraic data types
                 subsume the concepts known in the literature as indexed
                 types, guarded recursive datatype constructors,
                 (first-class) phantom types, and equality qualified
                 types, and are closely related to inductive types.
                 Their characteristic property is to allow every branch
                 of a case construct to be typechecked under different
                 assumptions about the type variables in scope. We prove
                 that {HMG$(X)$} is sound and that, provided recursive
                 definitions carry a type annotation, type inference can
                 be reduced to constraint solving. Constraint solving is
                 decidable, at least for some instances of $X$, but
                 prohibitively expensive. Effective type inference for
                 guarded algebraic data types is left as an issue for
                 future research.}

                 polymorphic type system in the style of Hindley and

                 extracts proof obligations out of programs annotated
                 with logical assertions. These proof obligations,
                 expressed in a typed, higher-order logic, are
                 discharged using off-the-shelf automated or interactive
                 theorem provers. Although the technical apparatus that
                 we exploit is by now standard, its application to
                 functional programming languages appears to be new, and
                 (we claim) deserves attention. As a sample application,
                 we check the partial correctness of a balanced binary
                 search tree implementation.}

    abstract = {{Dependent types are useful for statically checking detailed specifications of programs and detecting pattern match or array bounds errors. We propose a novel approach to applications of dependent types to practical programming languages: Instead of requiring programmers' declaration of dependent function types (as in Dependent ML) or trying to infer them from function definitions only (as in size inference), we mine the output specification of a dependent function from the function's call sites, and then propagate that specification backward to infer the input specification. We have implemented a prototype type inference system which supports higher-order functions, parametric polymorphism, and algebraic data types based on our approach, and obtained promising experimental results.}},
